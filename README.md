# TvT Game of Guns
A Gungame clone.

## Building
To build use `bash build.sh`.

## Maintenance
To blacklist weapons, locally host the mission and type `#blacklistUtility`. In the following dialog, activate the checkboxes of all weapons you want to blacklist, then hit *export*. Note that weapons that are already in the blacklist will be preselected. Add your clipboard to `cfgMission >> weaponBlacklist`.
